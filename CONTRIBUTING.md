Consider Contributing OpenSextant
=================================

OpenSextant is our umbrella project, not a particular module.
The contributors are loosely affiliated, but largely volunteers.

* If you have ideas it is best to contact the author, here for Xponents == Marc Ubaldino, mubaldino@gmail.com
* If you have specific requests or bug fixes related to current APIs, please file an issue at https://github.com/OpenSextant/XText/issues

This is a research prototype that is consistently funded, but please have some patience and willingness to do some of the work.
Collaborators that have a sincere interest may be considered to join the group.
