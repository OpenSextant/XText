Apache Tika is awesome
----------------------
Tika  provides all sorts of solid content conversion and parsing capabilities.  XText wraps around Tika basics but 
also provides a lean design for added other extractors/converters and customizing the output of any converter.   
XText API is intended to be a simple core:  filter and convert documents to textual versions.   It provides a 
number of parameters for how the conversions are managed including where to cache conversions, and file size limits.  
Beyond the conversion of a single item, XText attempts to look at the larger topic of converting compound 
documents (email archive/account, archival formats, web page, embedded documents).

Supported Document Conversions
------------------------------
Major file conversions supported include:
* Anything Tika can do. By default the Tika AutoDetectParser is employed.
* Email message archiving (traverse RFC822 MIME message, saving attachments, etc) and traversal, conversion, etc.
* Limited web crawl and archiving crawls
* JPEG EXIF parsing (saves full EXIF header as text; EXIF location & time as metadata)
* Support for Embedded Object extraction

Major features added beyond Tika
------------------------------

Conversion caching/archiving: conversions can be maintained close to originals or in parallel structure
Metadata preservation: metadata about original and the conversion process are persisted with conversions
XText adds some typical conventions for integrators who wish to use a document conversion tool rather than the 
bare Tika library.   Such features include:

- document file type filters
- logging and metrics
- input/output options for saving converted documents and related metadata
- lightweight listener design so you can unpack, convert and process all in the same loop
- formalizing the document meta-data practices: that is, what metadata is really important and how do we store it with the converted document


Supported customizations:

* PDF metadata harvesting (from Tika/PDFBox);  Detecting of encrypted PDFs
* Web content scrapping;  Default HTML parser is Tika's, but for web articles, Boilerplate parser is better.
* Decomposing and extracting text from compound documents
* Content is normalized to UTF-8 with unix line endings ('\n') only.
* Java Documentation contains what you need to know for development.

Basic Usage
-----------
```

  Running it: From a release, see

       ./script/README_convert.txt
       ./script/convert.sh or convert.bat script

       USAGE: 
       ./script/convert.sh   -input FOLDER -output FOLDER  [ other options ]

       ANT: 
       ant -f ./script/xtext-ant.xml -Dinputfile=./test/somestuff/  convert
       

  Build:

       ant -f ./build-dist.xml

       Or

       mvn install 
```
  

RELEASE NOTES
================

v3.0  INDEPENDENCE DAY 2018
-----------------------------
- OpenSextant Xponents 3.0 release

v2.10.7 
-----------------------------
- Moved XText out of Xponents folder.

v2.6 through v2.10 
-----------------------------
- Just keeping pace with the rest of Xponents releases

v2.5.1  SUMMER, 2014
------------------------------
- PDFBox updated
- JavaDoc improvements, looking to Java 8 stringent javadoc checking
- Added Outlook PST support (initial). via java-libpst.  This support is planned for Tika 1.6.
- PathManager construct added to offload complexities of dealing with caching, crawling, collecting.

v1.4  ST PATRICK's DAY, 2014
------------------------------
- Added Tika 1.5 as primary conversion tool
- Introduced content collectors: Email, web, Sharepoint
- Added MessageConverter for email traversal, conversion and archiving. 
- Added OLEConverter to support MS object conversion, e.g. Outlook message files (untested)
- Added ImageConverter which saves full EXIF header as text and preserves interesting GPS location and date/time as formal metadata that can be retrieved later.

v1.0  ST PATRICK's  DAY, 2013
------------------------------
- initial design
- added Testing archive -- not released;  UBL Letters from SOCOM where released Fall 2012.  They are PDFs and Word docs in English and Arabic.  They offer a good test opportunity.
